**IRIS FLOWER SPECIES MACHINE LEARNING MODEL**


Welcome to the IRIS FLOWER SPECIES  ML Predictor! This project uses Machine Learning to predict species of IRIS flower on various features.


**About:**
This application utilizes Random Forest Classifier model trained on in built iris dataset of scikit learn  to provide you the name of species on specific features.
â€¢	The RandomForestClassifier is chosen for this project due to its ability to give high accuracy rate, making it suitable for species prediction (Setosa, Versicolo, Verginica)
